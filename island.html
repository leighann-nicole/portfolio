			<h1>Island Book One: Shipwreck</h1>
		    <h2>2025</h2>
			<h2>Gordan Korman</h2>
			<h2>Trade Book</h2>
			<p><em>Island</em> by Gordan Korman was of my favourite series growing up. I had (still have) a nautical phase and I consumed every book about ships and shipwrecks and deserted islands I could get my little hands on. I discovered Gordan Korman through my primary school's Scholastic fair and ordered the series with what little money my parents gave me to spend. Since then I've read and reread them, and made my way through his other series such as <em>Dive</em> and <em>Everest</em> (I also had an mountain climbing and scuba diving phase). In my final semester at Okanagan College we were tasked to redesign one of our favourite books. I picked <em>Island</em> because there are some design elements that, while not bothersome when I was a kid, make it hard to reread as an adult. My goal with the redesign was to make the book more visually appealing, less monochromatic, and easier on the eyes to read. <em>Island</em> was set in Roca with Acier BAT for cover and chapter titles and Chandler42 for subheadings. The covers went through several rounds of edits before the final design was chosen. This cover image was sourced from unsplash. Jason if you're reading this, this is NOT my final draft this is my old one from class because I wanted to submit my website first.</p>
